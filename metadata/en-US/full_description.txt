A simple app to create and manage georeferences notes (text and photos) on a map. The goal is to create the notes very fast and without any unnecessary UI/UX overhead. One possible use-case is to collect geospatial data which can be later uploaded to OpenStreetMap.

Currently the basic features are:
<ul>
<li>Create, move and delete notes on a map</li>
<li>Attach photos to a note</li>
<li>List of all notes</li>
<li>Export all notes in GeoJson format</li>
<li>Show and follow current location</li>
</ul>
